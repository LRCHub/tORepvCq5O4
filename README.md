[00:05.23] Yeah
[00:07.23] 
[00:05.57] The fuck a ring, bitch, I like to cheat, I bought some gold feet
[00:08.98] Put that on my old-school Capris, dunk it like Dominique
[00:12.36] Yeah, feelin' good, feelin' great, ho
[00:15.57] Got my cake up, they gon' wake up, taste the yayo, the yayo
[00:18.91] L.A. price was high, I went to Daygo
[00:21.38] Big Mitchy got me sitchy, sippin' chickies out of state, yo, like
[00:24.63] Yeah, feelin' fine, feelin' good, bitch
[00:27.60] Got some bougie hos who still gon' fuck a hood bitch
[00:53.60] 
[00:30.37] So do it, bitch, go 'head, let me strike it, you know how I like it
[00:33.45] She said, "All my stripper friends invited," only if they dykin'
[00:36.52] And I just left the Bentley lot so icy, they want me indicted
[00:39.61] Sleep with one eye open, always lurkin', movin' in silence
[00:42.46] Left Eye, rest in peace, I like to creep, fucked her on gold feet
[00:45.61] You can hit 15th on the east, pick up a whole ki'
[00:48.67] Used to be out west with the work, servin' the Chinatown
[00:51.81] Lord and then get caught with the pipes, I had to pipe it down, down
[01:25.81] 
[00:55.96] Feelin' good, feelin' great (great, great)
[00:58.28] Feelin' great, feelin' good, how are you, nigga? How are you?
[01:01.40] I'm in the Ritz, finna mix with a thick bitch, how 'bout you?
[01:03.67] Say you wanna win, fuck nigga, but you really can't miss your wind, but you gotta jump through
[01:06.80] Ten in my Benz, put it on new shoes
[01:08.23] Fuck rap niggas, I don't do new crews
[01:09.71] Niggas get ignorant and get to kickin' shit
[01:11.32] We get to killin' shit, too much to lose
[01:31.32] 
[01:12.89] I don't be chasin' these bitches, don't choose
[01:14.40] Breakin' your ho while you breakin' the news
[01:15.96] Niggas irrelevant without their bitch
[01:17.35] I'm a motherfuckin' pimp, so I'm makin' the rules, I'm makin' the rules, bitch
[01:20.65] Feelin' good, feelin' great (great, great)
[01:22.95] Feelin' great, feelin' good, how are you, nigga? How are you?
[01:25.89] I'm in the Ritz, finna mix with a thick bitch, how 'bout you? Yeah (Look)
[01:29.52] Finna whip this brick, nigga, how 'bout you? (Look)
[01:55.02] 
[01:31.33] Bro, I'm coolin', lookin' ghoulish, feelin' great, the flow is fluid
[01:34.54] Flames, fires in the nighttime, dancin' around, the barrel bangs (bang)
[01:37.98] Layin' in that bed you made, gangsters in my DNA
[01:40.63] Jeans through the seams, tailor-made, it's hard to fabricate
[01:43.71] Back to back with stacks of platinum plaques, you know my résumé
[01:46.63] Lil' buddy was slingin' and catchin' plays on the eastside in a leather A
[01:49.64] Beatin' the block with a heavy bass, damn, fleein' the cops
[01:52.19] Schemin' on them in a ski mask, in the summer inside of the city
[02:24.19] 
[01:54.88] Don't care if you see 'em or not, it's insidious
[01:56.55] I'm in Italy with Sicilians, standin' on stage, no, spitting soliloquies
[01:59.80] I'm a sinner, my life is a cinema, send me a script, I could be on a big screen
[02:02.73] Bunch of bad women with the cinnamon skin
[02:04.47] She send me a pic', it's a dick tea'
[02:05.76] Let's be serious, I got experience, win the series like I play for the big leagues (oh, shit, oh, shit)
[02:57.26] 
[02:09.25] Okay, I'm feelin' great, feelin' good, I fill a tank, hit the bank, get a dub (oh, shit, oh, shit, whoa)
[02:12.53] Fuck a vape, fill a pape', full of bud, take a drag, take a drink
[02:15.16] Drawin' blanks, what's your name? I forgot what it was
[02:17.04] But what a day with my head in the clouds
[02:18.60] Moved around, thought it only was us
[02:20.06] But niggas don't counter the camera
[02:21.18] Then chill in Mechanicsville, cuttin', cookin' the chemicals
[02:23.22] Kamikaze but no cannibalism
[02:24.69] He caught a body, ain't know what to do with him
[02:48.69] 
[02:26.16] I think about it back when we was just little
[02:27.62] Now I'm excited and it's on for a milli'
[02:29.13] It's kinda crazy when you do the comparisons
[02:30.92] Really 'cause both of us making a killin'
[02:32.38] I'm feelin' good, I'm great, I'm straight, my boy
[02:34.10] Can't too many niggas relate, my boy
[02:35.80] Okay, I shift shapes
[02:36.90] I ain't shootin' the shit, they was throwin' shade
[02:38.33] I'ma throw a fist like Sugar Shane
[02:39.74] Can't really even ask nigga, "How your day?
[03:01.24] 
[02:41.59] How are you? How are things?"
[02:42.46] Shit bad, bitch, I might go insane like Howard Hughes
[02:44.44] 'Cause I can cop a plane like Howard too
[02:45.90] On the money chase with a wild goose
[02:47.60] Nigga, I ain't really fazed, I follow through
[02:49.02] Goin' out in a blaze, like tower two (oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit)
[02:53.09] How 'bout you? Uh, look
[02:55.06] Finna mix with a thick bitch, how 'bout you? Uh
